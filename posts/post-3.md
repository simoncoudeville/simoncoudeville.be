I've been designing and building websites for allmost 20 years. When I started studying websites were build with sliced up spacer images inside nested tables for layout and html tags like `<font color="red">` for other styling.

The first time I learned about CSS was on an internship where I had the chance to experiment with it. Since that time I was hooked and became better and better at it. It's safe to say that by now it is my second language. Over time I have seen CSS evolve from a trickery mess to the modern language it is today.

It's a way to write a design. Most of the time I start designing by writing CSS.
To me CSS is a design language.

I've allways had a url where I put some stuff on, but I never had a blog. There were many attempts, but I allways had an excuse to not finish it. The main problem is that I really like designing websites and putting it all together but once that's done I loose my interest. Even when I was still playing with Lego it was the same. The fun part for me was building the model. Once it was finished, I remember looking at it in awe for a few hours

These are all ofcourse a bunch of excuses.
